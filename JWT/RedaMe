JWT
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.



how JWT works(JSON Web Token)(Steps)

A client sends username/password combination to the server
The server validates the authentication
If authentication is successful, the server creates a JWT token else establishes an error response
On successful authentication, the client gets JWT token in the response body
Client stores that token in local storage or session storage.
From next time, the client for making any request supplies the JWT token in request headers like this. Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Server upon receiving the JWT validates it and sends the successful response else error.
