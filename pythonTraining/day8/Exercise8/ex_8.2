Question 1:
Create a range a which starts from 0 and goes on for 20 numbers.
Ans: a=range(20)


Question 2:Create a range b which starts from 3 and ends on 12.
Ans:b=range(3,12)


Question 3:Create a range c which contains every third integer starting from 2 and ending at 50.
Ans:c=range(2,51,3)

if you wnat to see the values you should convert it into list
e,\.g

>>> c=range(2,51,3)
>>> print(c)
range(2, 51, 3)
>>> range(20)
range(0, 20)
>>> list(range(20))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
>>> list(range(2,51,3))
[2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50]
>>>
