Exercise 5.2
Question 1=
fot what values of x this program print "True"?

if not x>5:
	print("True")

Ans: for x=0,1,2,3,4,5

Question 2:
For what values of absentee_rate and overall_mark will this program print "You have passed the course."?

if absentee_rate <= 5 and overall_mark >= 50:
    print("You have passed the course.")
Ans:
The program will print "You have passed the course."
 if absentee_rate is less than or equal to 5 and overall_mark is greater than or equal to 50.

Question 3:
for what value of x will this program print "true"?
if X>1or x<=8:
	print("True")
Ans:
The program print "True".
if x is greater than 1 or x is less than equal to 8

Question4:

Eliminate not from each of these boolean expressions:

not total <= 2
not count > 40
not (value > 20.0 and total != 100.0)
not (angle > 180 and width == 5)
not (count == 5 and not (value != 10) or count > 50)
not (value > 200 or value < 0 and not total == 0)

total > 2
count <= 40
value <= 20.0 or total == 100.0
angle <= 180 or width != 5
(count != 5 or value != 10) and count <= 50
value <= 200 and (value >= 0 or total == 0)
