Exercise 10
Question 1:
Which of these fragments are valid and invalid first lines of if statements? Explain why:

if (x > 4)
if x == 2
if (y =< 4)
if (y = 5)
if (3 <= a)
if (1 - 1)
if ((1 - 1) <= 0)
if (name == "James")

if (x > 4) – valid
if x == 2 – valid (brackets are not compulsory)
if (y =< 4) – invalid (=< is not a valid operator; it should be <=)
if (y = 5) – invalid (= is the assignment operator, not a comparison operator)
if (3 <= a) – valid
if (1 - 1) – valid (1 - 1 evaluates to zero, which is false)
if ((1 - 1) <= 0) – valid
if (name == "James") – valid

Question2 :

What is the output of the following code fragment? Explain why.

x = 2

if x > 3:
    print("This number")
print("is greater")
print("than 3.")


Ans: output is :
"is greate than 3"
because condition will be false and it will executed the statement which are outside of if block.

Question 3:
How can we simplify these code fragments?

code 1:
if bool(a) == True:
    print("a is true")

code 2:
if x > 50:
    b += 1
    a = 5
else:
    b -= 1
    a=5


we can simplify code 1
if bool(a):
	print("a is true")

we can simplify code 2:
a=5
if x>50:
	b+=1
else:
        b -=1
