Write down why each of the entries in the left column will raise a syntax error  if it is used as an identifier.

Entry1
why syntax error= space not allowed 
why bad practice= we can use as 'PRcrd' but we can not get exact mening of it so it is bad practice.
why good practice= it is good practice because we get meaning also and it is in proper syntax

Entry2
why syntax error= '-' not allowed 
why bad practice= we can use as 'DEHAULT-ht' but again (what is ht? here) we can not get exact mening of it so it is bad practice.
why good practice= it is good practice because we get meaning also and it is in proper syntax.


Entry3
why syntax error= class is a keyword we can not use it as a identifier
why bad practice= we can use it as 'Class' but if we give it proper name then better.
why good practice=it is good practice because we get meaning 

Entry4
why syntax error='2totalweight' it is not allowed because it is start from number
why bad practice= as 'num2' we can use it but not get exact meaning
why good practice= using 'total_weight' got what is exact meaning also it is in proper way so it is good practice(eg. !total-weight)
